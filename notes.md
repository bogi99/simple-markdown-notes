# title text

## this is a training file for markdown

### third title:



to start the paragraph, just keep typing , as you normally would, and continue with your typing , using normal punctuation and grammar as you do.

it will get formatted as a paragraph

**sometimes** you want to __bold__ some text

 _sometimes_ you want to put it in _italics_

 and sure , you can ___combine___ the two for ***very*** important stuff.


and now to the blockquotes, generally people don't need to do them, but we are developers, and we thrive in stuff we can put in blockquotes :-)

**lists**

they are fun.

first ordered lists:

1. first
2. second

also we can do

1. one
2. two
    1. sub one
    2. sub two
3. three

then the orderless lists

- item
- item

also

- item
- item
    - second level item
    - second level item
        - third level item
        - another third level item

**code blocks**

yep, we aint done yet, we can do whole code blockquotes

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>


and when you are done, just drop the two tabs

or use the backtick to mark your code blocks, you can escape the backtick with another backtick , note single quote also works fine


`

    #! /bin/bash

    DATA = "seven ducks"

    echo $DATA

**Images**

Absolute magic i say

![Tux , The Linux mascot](tux.png)

i mean it's the path to the file , but in this case i put it right next to the markup file.

I am not sure if git hub is going to render this correctly, my understanding is, git hub's markup rendering isn't 100% and it doesn't render everything , but i could be wrong here.
